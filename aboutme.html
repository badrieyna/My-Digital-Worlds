<h1>Let's Get To Know Me !</h1>
<p>Hi, everyone! My name is <b>⋆˚ Badrieyna  𝜗𝜚˚⋆</b></p>

<p>I'm pursuing Diploma in Library Informatics at UiTM Kedah. It was quite challenging at first because I have to survive the distance from Johor- Kedah without any family members or mutual contacts, but anyways, here I am !</p>

<p>Standing strong still even with a little ups and downs. Well, as I always heard, "What is life without struggle and challenges?" <em>Right ?!</em></p>

<p>Allow me to share some facts about myself which might be fun news or boring depends on your perspective ✧</p>

<div style="border: 3px solid purple; padding:10px; background-color:#EFD9CE;">

<p>Heyy I'm joking. I enjoy <span id="highlight" style="background-color:LightBlue;">baking</span> a lot ! Maybe because I am a sweet-tooth, therefore, I love baking desserts and not to mention, enjoying self-made desserts without limit.</p>

<p>I once discovered a quotes that I thought was and still is iconic about desserts. However, it doesn't really relate to my life but I still like it.</p>

Stressed is just desserts spelled backwards, so enjoy your life as it is.

My favourite one is: <q style="color:green;"><em>Feeling downie ? Eat a brownie</em></q></p>

<blockquote>For me, baking is not just making sweet desserts all day long.
<br>It's stitching pieces of my soul into feelings that speak for me through food.
